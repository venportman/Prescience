Prescience
==========

Prescience is a distributed public messageboard everyone can write to and read. 

Features (to be implemented)

- Anyone can write short messages (140 characters) to the shared database using a unique id. 
- All messages are recorded and preserved for as long as prescience exists.
- Messages are timestamped on their way into Prescience.
- Clients can download the entire Prescience database to explore. 
- Database is distributed across all nodes, like Bit Torrent and the Blockchain.
- All messages are transmitted in the clear. If you want to send DMs, use client-side encryption + private keys.
